[[Original Dataset](https://github.com/google-research-datasets/conceptual-12m)] [[Dataset Download](https://depia.wiki/files/cc12m.jsonl.zst)]

Conceptual 12M (CC12M), a dataset with ~12 million image-text pairs meant to be used for vision-and-language pre-training. It is larger and covers a much more diverse set of visual concepts than the Conceptual Captions (CC3M), a dataset that is widely used for pre-training and end-to-end training of image captioning models. Check our paper for further details.
