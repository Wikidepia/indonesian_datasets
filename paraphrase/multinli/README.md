The Multi-Genre Natural Language Inference (MultiNLI) corpus is a crowd-sourced collection of 433k sentence pairs annotated with textual entailment information. The corpus is modeled on the SNLI corpus, but differs in that covers a range of genres of spoken and written text, and supports a distinctive cross-genre generalization evaluation. The corpus served as the basis for the shared task of the RepEval 2017 Workshop at EMNLP in Copenhagen.
