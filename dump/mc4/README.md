# "Clean" mC4

[[Original Dataset](https://github.com/allenai/allennlp/discussions/5265)]]

Indonesian mC4 with filtering from spam, NSFW, and Gambling. Big thanks to AllenAI for releasing Multilingual C4 üôè.

## Filtering Steps

1. Remove text from CCAligned domain (Why? CCAligned sometimes contains machine translated website.)
2. Find porn-y and gambling words, if it exceeds certain threshold it wont be included.
3. Train fasttext clasifier from (NSFW & Gambling) and (Indonesian CC-NEWS) text and classify text with it.
